8. FEASIBILITY STUDY

Risk Identification: Technical challenges, changing requirements, data security vulnerabilities.

Risk Prioritization:
 
Data Security Breach:

The unauthorized access to sensitive applicant data, leading to potential privacy violations and reputational damage.
System Downtime:

The risk of the application system being unavailable due to technical issues or maintenance, resulting in lost opportunities for both applicants and recruiters.
Poor User Experience:

Issues with the user interface or application process leading to dissatisfaction among applicants, potentially deterring them from completing their applications or applying in the future.
Legal and Compliance Concerns:

Non-compliance with data protection regulations, equal opportunity employment laws, or other legal requirements, exposing the organization to fines, lawsuits, or damage to its reputation.
Inadequate Applicant Screening:

Failure to properly screen applicants, resulting in the potential hiring of unqualified candidates or overlooking qualified ones, leading to productivity losses and potential risks to the organization.
Insufficient Scalability:

The inability of the system to handle a large volume of applicants during peak periods, causing slowdowns or crashes and impacting recruitment timelines.
Integration Challenges:

Difficulties in integrating the job application system with existing HR systems, leading to data inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and potential errors in the recruitment process.
Dependency on Third-party Services:

Reliance on third-party services for critical functionalities such as background checks or document verification, with the risk of service disruptions or data breaches affecting the recruitment process.
Lack of Disaster Recovery Plan:

The absence of a robust disaster recovery plan in case of system failures or data loss, leading to prolonged downtime and loss of critical data.
Inadequate Training and Support:

Lack of proper training and support for recruiters and HR administrators in using the system effectively, resulting in errors, delays, and suboptimal utilization of the platform.
Prioritizing these risks enables the organization to allocate resources efficiently and implement appropriate risk management strategies to mitigate potential threats to the job application system.
